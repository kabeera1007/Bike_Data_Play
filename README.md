## Workflow

This project integrates several tools and processes to manage the workflow:

***Tools***:
  
- **DBT**: Data transformation and analysis.
- **Airflow**: Task scheduling and orchestration.
- **Spark**: Data processing.
- **Docker**: Containerization.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure management.
- **GCS**: Cloud computing.
  
  ***Steps***:
  
- **Step 1**:  Using spark.
- **Step 2**:  Using dbt and gcs.
- **Step 3**:  Using docker, terraform, airflow .
  

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **analyses/**: Contains DBT analysis scripts.
- **dags/**: Airflow DAGs for task scheduling.
- **macros/**: Custom DBT macros.
- **models/**: DBT models for data transformation.
- **scripts/**: Project setup scripts.
- **seeds/**: Raw data for seeding DBT models.
- **snapshots/**: DBT snapshots for table versioning.
- **spark_notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks for Spark-based analysis.
- **terraf/**: Terraform configuration files.
- **tests/**: DBT tests for data quality.
- **.gitignore**: Git ignore file for unwanted files.
- **Dockerfile**: Docker configuration for the project.
- **docker-compose.yaml**: Docker Compose configuration for container orchestration.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies for the project.

## Data

The dataset contains Divvy bike-sharing trip data from 2020 to 2024.

- **Rows**: 20 million +

The columns include:

- **ride_id**: Unique ID assigned to each Divvy trip.
- **rideable_type**: Type of vehicle used (bike or scooter).
- **started_at**: Start date and time of the trip.
- **ended_at**: End date and time of the trip.
- **start_station_name**: Name of the start station.
- **start_station_id**: Unique ID of the start station.
- **end_station_name**: Name of the end station.
- **end_station_id**: Unique ID of the end station.
- **start_lat**: Latitude of the start station.
- **start_lng**: Longitude of the start station.
- **end_lat**: Latitude of the end station.
- **end_lng**: Longitude of the end station.
- **member_casual**: Whether the rider is a Divvy member or a casual user.
